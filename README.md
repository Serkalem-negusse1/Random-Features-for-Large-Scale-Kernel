# Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines

Implementation of the paper ["Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines"](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/07.rah.rec.nips.pdf) by Rahimi & Recht (NIPS 2007). This project visualizes:
- **Random Fourier Features (RFF)** for shift-invariant kernels (e.g., Gaussian).
- **Random Binning Features (RBF)** for separable kernels (e.g., Laplacian).
- Theoretical convergence bounds and empirical comparisons with kernel SVMs.
